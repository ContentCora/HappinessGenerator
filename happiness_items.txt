Have a cuddle with your kid in bed in the morning.
Tell your kid that you love him or her.
Sleep in on weekends.
Realize you know a song or poem by heart and recite it.
Colour in a mandala.
Drink a ginger beer.
Bake your own bread.
Read letters and cards written to you when you were younger.
Smell the air right after a downpour.
Drink a perfectly crafted capuccino.
