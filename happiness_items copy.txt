Tell your kid that you love him or her.
Sleep in on weekends.
Realize you know a song or poem by heart and recite it.
Colour in a mandala.
Drink a ginger beer. Of the nice kind, you know the ones.
Bake your own bread. The brown sourdough version is best.
Read letters and cards written to you when you were younger.
Smell the air right after a downpour.
Drink a perfectly crafted capuccino.
